# remote-ftp-transfer
Transfer large files directly between servers in few seconds leveraging on server internet speed.

Here is a major benefit of using this remote ftp transfer script:

Your files will be transferred using the high speed internet access of the online server, so even if you are in a place with poor network this script comes in handy and your large files will be transferred at lowest data consumption to you because all you are doing is loading a simple webpage and sending a single request.

# Documentation
Migrating data from one server to another is a very stressful process, especially when you are switching between hosting companies.

downloading your files from your old server to your local system and re-uploading on a new server will cost you a large data consumption and if your internet speed isn't jetfast you could spend days just to move files in between online servers.

this snippet would come in handy, it works based on the file transfer protocol (FTP).

# Usage
create an ftp account on your old server and note down the (server Ip or URL, and the ftp credentials you just created)

compress the files you want to migrate to the new server and note the filename (including the extension)

Upload this remote ftp transfer script on your new hosting server in the directory you want the files to be saved.

Run this script by opening the public url e.g (http://example.com/ftptransfer.php)

Fill in the ftp credentials and the filename from the old server.

Click on "Transfer File" and Voila!!!
